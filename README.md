# music-store-analysis-using-sql
The goal of the Music Store Analysis project is to thoroughly examine a music store's database in order to extract insightful data and identify patterns in sales, consumer behaviour, and product preferences. By utilising the strength of SQL (Structured Query Language), this project seeks to offer a thorough insight of the operations of the music shop.
